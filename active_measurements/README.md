# **Homework 1 - Active Measurements**

## **Objective**
The purpose of the homework is to evaluate the relationship between the (average) RTT and the physical distance between two endpoints.

The source endpoint is fixed and it is represented by the physical machine where the code is running, whereas the second endpoint is variable and placed at an increasing distance with respect to the first endpoint.
